# JavaScript Backend Directory :smile:

This directory contains the backend codebase for our project, built using JavaScript.

## Overview

This backend is designed to handle the server-side logic and interactions for our application. It communicates with the front end, processes data, and manages the application's core functionalities.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime used for server-side code execution.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js used to build APIs and handle HTTP requests.
- **(Database)**: Specify any databases or data stores used, like MongoDB, MySQL, etc.
- **(Other Dependencies)**: List any other major libraries or packages used in the backend.

## Installation

To set up and run the backend locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. **Navigate to the backend directory**: `cd backend`
3. **Install dependencies**: `npm install`
4. **Set up environment variables**: Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` and add necessary configuration.
5. **Start the server**: `npm start`

## Folder Structure

Describe the structure of the backend directory and its main components here. For example:

- **/src**: Contains the source code for the backend.
  - **/controllers**: Handles incoming HTTP requests and delegates logic.
  - **/models**: Defines data models and interacts with the database.
  - **/routes**: Contains API route definitions.
  - **/middlewares**: Custom middleware functions.
  - **/config**: Configuration files.
  - **/utils**: Utility functions.
- **/tests**: Contains unit tests for the backend.

## Usage

Explain how to use the backend, including endpoints, request payloads, and responses. Provide examples or references to API documentation if available.

## Testing

Explain how to run tests for the backend code. Include any setup required for testing and how to execute the test suite.

## Contributing

Guidelines and instructions for contributors if the project is open for contributions.
